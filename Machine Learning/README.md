# Visual Studio C++ Project (Original)

This folder contains the original C++ project created in Visual Studio.

## ⚠️ Important Note

The source code files (`.cpp` and `.hpp`) from this folder have been **copied** to the new organized structure:

- Common files and data handling → `1-Machine-Learning/cpp_implementations/`
- K-Means → `1-Machine-Learning/unsupervised/clustering/`
- KNN → `1-Machine-Learning/nearest_neighbors/`
- Neural network layers → `2-Deep-Learning/fundamentals/`

## 🔧 Usage

This folder can be kept if you want to:
1. Compile the project using Visual Studio on Windows
2. Use VS build configurations (`.vcxproj`, `.sln`)
3. Debug using Visual Studio environment

## 💡 Recommendation

- **For study and reference**: Use files in the new organized structure
- **For VS compilation**: Use this original folder
- **For cross-platform development**: Use files in `1-Machine-Learning/cpp_implementations/`

## 📁 Contents

- `Machine Learning.sln`: Visual Studio solution
- `Machine Learning/`: Source code and headers
- `x64/`: Compiled binaries (Debug/Release)

**You can delete this folder if you don't use Visual Studio or Windows.**
